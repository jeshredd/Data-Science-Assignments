This notebook focuses on implementing and understanding **Decision Tree algorithms** for classification and regression problems. It explains how decision trees split data, measure information gain, and evaluate performance.

## üìÇ Contents
- Introduction to Decision Trees  
- Data preprocessing  
- Building a Decision Tree Classifier  
- Model training and testing  
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)  

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

You will learn how decision trees work, how to implement them using `scikit-learn`, and how to evaluate their effectiveness in solving classification tasks.
