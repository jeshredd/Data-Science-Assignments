This project implements **Logistic Regression** for binary classification problems. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a model, and evaluate performance.

## Key Tasks
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Logistic regression model training
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve
