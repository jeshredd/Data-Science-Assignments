This notebook performs text classification on a subset of the 20 Newsgroups dataset (loaded as blogs.csv with 2000 samples across 20 categories). It includes data cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering), TF-IDF vectorization, Naive Bayes classification, model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1), and sentiment analysis using VADER on the classified texts.
Key Steps:

Load and explore data (df.info(), value counts).
Preprocess text (custom clean_text function).
Train/test split, TF-IDF, MultinomialNB model.
Classification report on test set (85% accuracy).
Sentiment distribution across categories (mostly positive, politics negative).
