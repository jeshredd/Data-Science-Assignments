This notebook trains SVM classifiers with different kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial) on mushroom edibility data. Includes GridSearchCV tuning, PCA for visualization, and decision region plots.
Key Steps:

Load mushroom dataset (~8,124 samples, 22 categorical features).
EDA: Encoding (LabelEncoder), feature distributions.
Models: SVC kernels; poly kernel best (~1.00 accuracy post-tuning).
Evaluation: Classification reports; PCA-reduced decision boundaries.
Analysis: Strengths (balanced classes); weaknesses (categorical handling, tuning time).
Interview Q&A: Kernel impacts, SVM pros/cons for this data.
