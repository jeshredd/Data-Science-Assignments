This project builds a **Neural Network model** to solve classification problems using **Keras/TensorFlow**. It demonstrates deep learning fundamentals and evaluates model performance.

## Key Tasks
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Building a feedforward neural network
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics and visualization (loss, accuracy curves)
