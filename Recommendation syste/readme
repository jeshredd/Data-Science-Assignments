This notebook implements a content-based filtering recommendation system for anime using genre-based cosine similarity. It preprocesses the dataset, computes similarity matrices, and recommends similar anime with tunable thresholds. Includes train/test split and notes on evaluation challenges without user interaction data.
Key Steps:

Load and explore anime.csv (12,294 anime entries).
Genre vectorization and cosine similarity computation.
Recommendation function with top-N and similarity threshold (optimal: 0.3).
Example: Recommendations for "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood" (e.g., similarity scores >0.3).
Discussion: No ground truth for precision/recall; relies on domain knowledge.
