This project applies **Association Rule Mining** to identify meaningful relationships between items in transactional data. Techniques like **Apriori** and **Eclat** are used to generate frequent itemsets and association rules.

## Key Tasks
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of **Apriori Algorithm**
- Extraction of strong rules using support, confidence, and lift
- Visualization of frequent itemsets
