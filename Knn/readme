This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for classification problems. It explores how distance metrics and the choice of K affect model accuracy.

## üìÇ Contents
- Introduction to KNN algorithm  
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Training a KNN Classifier  
- Hyperparameter tuning (choosing K)  
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix and accuracy score  

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`


You will understand how the KNN algorithm works, how to implement it using `scikit-learn`, and how to evaluate its performance.
