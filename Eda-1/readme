This notebook demonstrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to summarize datasets, detect patterns, and visualize relationships. EDA is an essential step in data science projects before applying machine learning models.

## 📂 Contents
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Handling missing values and duplicates  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps)  
- Correlation analysis  

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

You will learn how to clean and visualize data effectively, identify key insights, and prepare datasets for advanced modeling.
